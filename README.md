# Knight-Travails-Project
--> Solution to the Knight-Travails-Project JS as part of the Data Structure and Algorith curriculum of the Odin Project

--> Here, we solved for the Shortest Path a Knight can travel on an 8 * 8 dimension Standard Chess Board, Outputting the Route it took along the way.

--> Took a few days to finish this project so i left comments in the code on how it was finally implemented. 

Used a "queue" Array in place of a Queue data structure to store(Enqueue) all the positions travelled by the knight;  and a "visited Set" to keep record of all the enqueued positions.
